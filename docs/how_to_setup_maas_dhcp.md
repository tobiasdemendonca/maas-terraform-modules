# How to setup MAAS DHCP

You likely want to have a subnet available in MAAS that has DHCP enabled, perhaps to use as a PXE subnet. To enable MAAS-provided DHCP on a rack controller requires having a subnet available that will be used for DHCP, and an additional interface on the relevant rack controllers connected to this subnet. This guide details the manual steps required to achieve this, as there is no current way to manage this with Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before following this guide, ensure:
1. You have run the `maas-deploy` module.
2. You have identified the target rack controller hostname to enable DHCP on.

## Create a PXE subnet
Create a subnet for MAAS to serve DHCP from. If you already have one created, you can skip this section.


The LXD network must be created with DHCP disabled so that MAAS can provide DHCP. It may require NAT depending on your needs:
```bash
lxc network create maas-pxe
cat << __EOF | lxc network edit maas-pxe
config:
    ipv4.address: 10.20.0.1/24
    ipv4.dhcp: "false"
    ipv4.nat: "true"
    ipv6.address: none
description: ""
name: maas-pxe
type: bridge
used_by: []
managed: true
status: Created
locations:
- none
__EOF
```
## Attach the network to the rack controller
1. Identify the rack controller you would like MAAS to provide DHCP from. If `enable_rack_mode=True`, this will be a machine listed in the `terraform output maas_machines` of the `maas-deploy` module.
2. Attach the desired network (`maas-pxe`) to the desired rack controller (`$NAME`, for example `juju-2c9858-1`) as a new interface (`eth1`):
   ```
   lxc network attach maas-pxe $NAME eth1
   ```
3. SSH into the rack controller and identify the name of the new interface. It will be named differently to `eth1`, in this example `enp6s0`:
   ```bash
    ❯ lxc shell $NAME
    root@juju-9f8b50-1:~# ip a
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
        ...
        ...
        ...
    2: enp5s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
        ...
        ...
        ...
    3: enp6s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000    # The unconfigured interface
        link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   ```
4. As root, setup this interface with netplan using the identified name:
   ```
   netplan set --origin-hint 99-maas-pxe-network ethernets.enp6s0.addresses=[10.20.0.2/24]
   netplan apply
   ```
   > [!NOTE]
   > The above addresses assumes you may want to set a gateway as 10.20.0.1, which is outside of the scope of this document.
5. After a few moments, you should be able to see the relevant subnet discovered in MAAS, if network discovery is enabled. You can now use this network to enable DHCP using terraform.

## Enable DHCP on the discovered subnet with Terraform
You can now enable DHCP with Terraform:

1. Add the following to

   `/modules/maas-config/main.tf`
   ```hcl
   # Enable DHCP
   data "maas_rack_controller" "dhcp_rack" {
     hostname = var.rack_controller
   }

   data "maas_subnet" "pxe" {
     cidr = var.pxe_subnet
   }

   data "maas_fabric" "pxe_fabric" {
     name = data.maas_subnet.pxe[0].fabric
   }

   resource "maas_subnet_ip_range" "dhcp_range" {
     subnet   = data.maas_subnet.pxe[0].id
     type     = "dynamic"
     start_ip = cidrhost(data.maas_subnet.pxe[0].cidr, 99)
     end_ip   = cidrhost(data.maas_subnet.pxe[0].cidr, 254)
   }

   resource "maas_vlan_dhcp" "dhcp_enabled" {
     fabric                  = data.maas_fabric.pxe_fabric[0].id
     vlan                    = data.maas_subnet.pxe[0].vid
     primary_rack_controller = data.maas_rack_controller.dhcp_rack[0].id
     ip_ranges               = [maas_subnet_ip_range.dhcp_range[0].id]
   }
   ```
   `modules/maas-config/variables.tf`
   ```hcl
   variable "rack_controller" {
     description = "The hostname of the MAAS rack controller to enable DHCP on"
     type        = string
   }

   variable "pxe_subnet" {
     description = "The subnet to serve DHCP from the MAAS rack controller"
     type        = string
   }
   ```
   `config/maas-config/config.tfvars`, filling out the appropriate values
   ```hcl
   # The hostname of the MAAS rack controller to enable DHCP
   rack_controller = <$NAME of rack controller>
   # The subnet to serve DHCP from the MAAS rack controller
   pxe_subnet = "10.20.0.0/24"
   ```
1. Apply your new `maas-config` plan. You're done, DHCP should now be enabled on the specified rack.
