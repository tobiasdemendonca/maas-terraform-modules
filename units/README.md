# Units

This directory contains Terragrunt unit configuration files, to be consumed by explicit stacks. Each unit corresponds to a Terraform module, and is responsible for defining the source of the module, dependencies, and generic configuration inputs. 

To find example stacks that use the units in this directory, see [examples/stacks](../examples/stacks/README.md). 

To find example units that can be applied independently, see [examples/units](../examples/units/README.md).
